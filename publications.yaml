    Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative tool to discover and define cellular 
    phenotypes. While computational scRNA-seq methods are currently well suited for experiments representing 
    a single condition, technology, or species, analyzing multiple datasets simultaneously raises new challenges. 
    In particular, traditional analytical workflows struggle to align subpopulations that are present across 
    datasets, limiting the possibility for integrated or comparative analysis. Here, we introduce a new 
    computational strategy for scRNA-seq alignment, utilizing common sources of variation to identify shared 
    subpopulations between datasets as part of our R toolkit Seurat. We demonstrate our approach by aligning 
    scRNA-seq datasets of PBMCs under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced 
    across two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In 
    each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across datasets, and can identify 
    subpopulations that could not be detected by analyzing datasets independently. We anticipate that these methods
     will serve not only to correct for batch or technology-dependent effects, but also to facilitate general 
     comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states 
     respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.

    Droplet-based single cell RNA-seq has emerged as a powerful technique for massively parallel 
    cellular profiling. While these approaches offer the exciting promise to deconvolute cellular 
    heterogeneity in diseased tissues, the lack of cost-effective, reliable, and user-friendly 
    instrumentation has hindered widespread adoption of droplet microfluidic techniques. To address 
    this, we have developed a microfluidic control instrument that can be easily assembled from 3D 
    printed parts and commercially available components costing approximately $540. We adapted this
    instrument for massively parallel scRNA-seq and deployed it in a clinical environment to perform
    single cell transcriptome profiling of disaggregated synovial tissue from a rheumatoid arthritis
    patient. We sequenced 8,716 single cells from a synovectomy, revealing 16 transcriptomically 
    distinct clusters. These encompass a comprehensive and unbiased characterization of the 
    autoimmune infiltrate, including inflammatory T and NK subsets that contribute to disease 
    biology. Additionally, we identified fibroblast subpopulations that are demarcated via THY1 
    (CD90) and CD55 expression. Further experiments confirm that these represent synovial fibroblasts 
    residing within the synovial intimal lining and subintimal lining, respectively, each under the 
    influence of differing microenvironments. We envision that this instrument will have broad utility 
    in basic and clinical settings, enabling low-cost and routine application of microfluidic 
    techniques, and in particular single-cell transcriptome profiling.

    Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play a central role in pathogen sensing, 
    phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized 
    subtypes. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully 
    understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of ~2400 cells,
    we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our 
    study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs 
    (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision 
    within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid 
    DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional 
    DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and 
    developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease.

    Single-cell RNA-seq can precisely resolve cellular states, but applying this method 
    to low-input samples is challenging. Here, we present Seq-Well, a portable, low-cost 
    platform for massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq. Barcoded mRNA capture beads and 
    single cells are sealed in an array of subnanoliter wells using a semipermeable 
    membrane, enabling efficient cell lysis and transcript capture. We use Seq-Well to 
    profile thousands of primary human macrophages exposed to \emph{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}.
