    Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative tool to discover and define cellular 
    phenotypes. While computational scRNA-seq methods are currently well suited for experiments representing 
    a single condition, technology, or species, analyzing multiple datasets simultaneously raises new challenges. 
    In particular, traditional analytical workflows struggle to align subpopulations that are present across 
    datasets, limiting the possibility for integrated or comparative analysis. Here, we introduce a new 
    computational strategy for scRNA-seq alignment, utilizing common sources of variation to identify shared 
    subpopulations between datasets as part of our R toolkit Seurat. We demonstrate our approach by aligning 
    scRNA-seq datasets of PBMCs under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced 
    across two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In 
    each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across datasets, and can identify 
    subpopulations that could not be detected by analyzing datasets independently. We anticipate that these methods
     will serve not only to correct for batch or technology-dependent effects, but also to facilitate general 
     comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states 
     respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.

    Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to diverse cell types in the blood system, yet our molecular 
    understanding of the early trajectories that generate this enormous diversity in humans remains incomplete. 
    Here, we leverage Drop‐seq, a massively parallel single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) approach, to 
    individually profile 20,000 progenitor cells from human cord blood, without prior enrichment or depletion for 
    individual lineages based on surface markers. Our data reveal a transcriptional compendium of progenitor states 
    in human cord blood, representing four committed lineages downstream from HSC, alongside the transcriptional 
    dynamics underlying fate commitment. We identify intermediate stages that simultaneously co‐express “primed” 
    programs for multiple downstream lineages, and also observe striking heterogeneity in the early molecular 
    transitions between myeloid subsets. Integrating our data with a recently published scRNA‐seq dataset from 
    human bone marrow, we illustrate the molecular similarity between these two commonly used systems and further 
    explore the chromatin dynamics of “primed” transcriptional programs based on ATAC‐seq. Finally, we demonstrate 
    that Drop‐seq data can be utilized to identify new heterogeneous surface markers of cell state that correlate 
    with functional output.

  abstract: >
    Diverse subsets of cortical interneurons have vital roles in higher-order brain functions. To investigate how 
    this diversity is generated, here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of mouse cells 
    collected along a developmental time course. Heterogeneity within mitotic progenitors in the ganglionic eminences 
    is driven by a highly conserved maturation trajectory, alongside eminence-specific transcription factor expression 
    that seeds the emergence of later diversity. Upon becoming postmitotic, progenitors diverge and differentiate into 
    transcriptionally distinct states, including an interneuron precursor state. By integrating datasets across 
    developmental time points, we identified shared sources of transcriptomic heterogeneity between adult interneurons 
    and their precursors, and uncovered the embryonic emergence of cardinal interneuron subtypes. Our analysis revealed 
    that the transcription factor Mef2c, which is linked to various neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, 
    delineates early precursors of parvalbumin-expressing neurons, and is essential for their development. These findings 
    shed new light on the molecular diversification of early inhibitory precursors, and identify gene modules that may 
    influence the specification of human interneuron subtypes.

    Droplet-based single cell RNA-seq has emerged as a powerful technique for massively parallel 
    cellular profiling. While these approaches offer the exciting promise to deconvolute cellular 
    heterogeneity in diseased tissues, the lack of cost-effective, reliable, and user-friendly 
    instrumentation has hindered widespread adoption of droplet microfluidic techniques. To address 
    this, we have developed a microfluidic control instrument that can be easily assembled from 3D 
    printed parts and commercially available components costing approximately $540. We adapted this
    instrument for massively parallel scRNA-seq and deployed it in a clinical environment to perform
    single cell transcriptome profiling of disaggregated synovial tissue from a rheumatoid arthritis
    patient. We sequenced 8,716 single cells from a synovectomy, revealing 16 transcriptomically 
    distinct clusters. These encompass a comprehensive and unbiased characterization of the 
    autoimmune infiltrate, including inflammatory T and NK subsets that contribute to disease 
    biology. Additionally, we identified fibroblast subpopulations that are demarcated via THY1 
    (CD90) and CD55 expression. Further experiments confirm that these represent synovial fibroblasts 
    residing within the synovial intimal lining and subintimal lining, respectively, each under the 
    influence of differing microenvironments. We envision that this instrument will have broad utility 
    in basic and clinical settings, enabling low-cost and routine application of microfluidic 
    techniques, and in particular single-cell transcriptome profiling.

    Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play a central role in pathogen sensing, 
    phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized 
    subtypes. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully 
    understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of ~2400 cells,
    we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our 
    study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs 
    (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision 
    within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid 
    DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional 
    DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and 
    developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease.

    Single-cell RNA-seq can precisely resolve cellular states, but applying this method 
    to low-input samples is challenging. Here, we present Seq-Well, a portable, low-cost 
    platform for massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq. Barcoded mRNA capture beads and 
    single cells are sealed in an array of subnanoliter wells using a semipermeable 
    membrane, enabling efficient cell lysis and transcript capture. We use Seq-Well to 
    profile thousands of primary human macrophages exposed to \emph{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}.
