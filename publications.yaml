  abstract: >
    Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play a central role in pathogen sensing, 
    phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized 
    subtypes. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully 
    understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of ~2400 cells,
    we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our 
    study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs 
    (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision 
    within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid 
    DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional 
    DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and 
    developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease.

    Single-cell RNA-seq can precisely resolve cellular states, but applying this method 
    to low-input samples is challenging. Here, we present Seq-Well, a portable, low-cost 
    platform for massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq. Barcoded mRNA capture beads and 
    single cells are sealed in an array of subnanoliter wells using a semipermeable 
    membrane, enabling efficient cell lysis and transcript capture. We use Seq-Well to 
    profile thousands of primary human macrophages exposed to \emph{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}.
