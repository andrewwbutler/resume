  abstract = {State machine replication is a technique used to guarantee the
  availability of a system even in the presence of faults. Agreement protocols
  are often used to implement state machine replication. However, the throughput
  of many agreement protocols, such as Paxos, does not scale with the number of
  machines available to the system. Systems whose throughput does scale often
  provide weaker consistency guarantees than state machine replication's
  linearizability. These weaker guarantees, such as eventual consistency, make
  the job of the application programmer much more difficult.

  Kapritsos and Junqueira previously proposed a protocol which uses an agreement
  protocol as a primitive and does scale. In this thesis, I describe my novel
  implementation of this protocol as well as the optimizations that were
  necessary to achieve scalability. The results of my experiments with this
  system show modest but promising evidence that the throughput of this system
  can, indeed, scale linearly with the number of machines.}
