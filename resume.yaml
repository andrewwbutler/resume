      - date: Summer 2013--Spring 2015
        topic: Computational Biology
        about: "Advisor: Claus Wilke"
        notes:
          - "Conducted research focused on improving multiple protein sequence alignment. Hidden markov models were used as the basis of these alignment algorithms in order to incorporate relevant biochemical/biophysical information into the alignments. Also contributed to a collaborative project aiming to better characterize bacterial metabolism. Worked primarily with RNA-Seq data to understand tRNA gene levels"
          - "Contributed to a collaborative project aiming to better characterize bacterial metabolism. Worked primarily with RNA-Seq data to understand tRNA gene levels. Work culminated in an honors thesis project."

      - date: Summer 2012 - Spring 2013
        topic: Virtual Drug Screening --- Freshman Research Initiative
        about: "Advisor: Josh Beckham"
        notes:
          - "Conducted preliminary drug discovery research. A combination of wet lab techniques and virtual high throughput screening methods were used in an attempt to find inhibitors for a protein target of interest. Worked primarily on a protein critical to viability in \\textit{Plasmodium falciparum}."
