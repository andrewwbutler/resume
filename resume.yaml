      - date: May 2016 - Present  
        topic: "Single Cell Genomics"
        about: "Advisor: Rahul Satija"
        notes:
          - "Currently conducting research on methods development for single-cell RNA-seq analsysis. Topics of interest include cell type identification through supervised and unsupervised analyses and methods for data integration. Also contributing as one of the lead developers to Seurat, the open source R package developed and maintained by the Satija lab."

      - date: Summer 2013 - Spring 2015
        topic: "Computational Biology"
        about: "Advisor: Claus Wilke"
        notes:
          - "Conducted research focused on improving multiple protein sequence alignment. Hidden markov models were used as the basis of these alignment algorithms in order to incorporate relevant biochemical/biophysical information into the alignments. Also contributed to a collaborative project aiming to better characterize bacterial metabolism. Worked primarily with RNA-Seq data to understand tRNA gene levels"
          - "Contributed to a collaborative project aiming to better characterize bacterial metabolism. Worked primarily with RNA-Seq data to understand tRNA gene levels. Work culminated in an honors thesis project."

      - date: Summer 2012 - Spring 2013
        topic: "Virtual Drug Screening --- Freshman Research Initiative"
        about: "Advisor: Josh Beckham"
        notes:
          - "Conducted preliminary drug discovery research. A combination of wet lab techniques and virtual high throughput screening methods were used in an attempt to find inhibitors for a protein target of interest. Worked primarily on a protein critical to viability in \\textit{Plasmodium falciparum}."
